# PRD: AI-Powered Email Agent  

## 1. Overview  
The Email Agent automates inbox management by:  
1. Connecting to a user’s email service via **IMAP**.  
2. Pulling down emails into a processing queue.  
3. Using **ChatGPT** to analyze and draft appropriate responses.  
4. Presenting replies for **user approval** before sending.  

The goal is to reduce manual email handling, accelerate drafting, and maintain human oversight on every outgoing email.

## 2. Objectives & Goals  
- **Accelerate email handling** with AI-generated draft replies.  
- Ensure **human-in-the-loop** review for every response.  
- **Seamlessly integrate** with standard email protocols (IMAP/SMTP).  
- Provide **custom rules and workflows** to prioritize messages.  
- Maintain **security and privacy** of user data.

## 3. Key Features  

### 3.1 Email Retrieval  
- Connect via **IMAP** to fetch inbox messages.  
- Support OAuth 2.0 and password authentication.  
- Apply filters (e.g., unread, flagged, priority).  

### 3.2 AI-Powered Response Generation  
- Pass email content and metadata to **ChatGPT**.  
- Generate context-aware responses (formal, casual, or customizable tone).  
- Handle edge cases (spam, system notifications, promotional mail).  
- Draft stored in the system until **user approval**.  

### 3.3 Review & Approval  
- User receives draft responses via:  
  - Web dashboard  
  - Desktop/mobile notifications (optional)  
- User can:  
  - Approve and send immediately.  
  - Edit before sending.  
  - Reject and discard.  
- **No emails are sent without explicit user confirmation.**  

### 3.4 Sending Replies  
- Connect via **SMTP** or equivalent sending protocol.  
- Maintain proper threading (In-Reply-To, References headers).  
- Send only after user approval.  

### 3.5 Rules & Customization  
- User-defined rules for prioritization (not auto-sending). Examples:  
  - Flag “urgent” messages for quick review.  
  - Ignore newsletters.  
  - Highlight specific senders.  
- Configurable tone and signature for drafts.  
- Option to auto-archive handled emails after approval.  

### 3.6 Security & Compliance  
- Encrypt all data in transit and at rest.  
- Stateless processing (no raw email stored outside user system).  
- Option to run agent locally or in secure cloud environment.  
- Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA (if handling sensitive data).

## 4. Technical Architecture  

### 4.1 High-Level Flow  
1. **Email Fetcher**: Uses IMAP to retrieve emails.  
2. **Pre-Processor**: Cleans, parses, and applies rules.  
3. **AI Response Generator**: Uses ChatGPT API to create drafts.  
4. **Approval Layer**: User reviews, edits, and approves.  
5. **Email Sender**: Sends via SMTP only after approval.  
6. **Logging & Analytics**: Tracks drafts, approvals, and errors.  

### 4.2 Tech Stack  
- Backend: Python (preferred) or Node.js  
- Email Libraries: `imaplib` / `imapclient` + `smtplib`  
- AI: OpenAI GPT API (fine-tuned or system prompts)  
- Database: Lightweight (SQLite/Postgres) for rules, logs, drafts  
- UI: Web dashboard for approval & settings

## 5. User Stories  

- *As a professional, I want AI to draft responses but require my approval before sending, so I maintain control over communication.*  
- *As a manager, I want to review and edit AI drafts to ensure responses align with my tone and priorities.*  
- *As a user, I want to define rules that flag or ignore specific emails, so my review process is efficient.*  

---

## 6. Success Metrics  
- **Time saved**: % reduction in manual drafting effort.  
- **User control**: 100% of emails pass through human approval.  
- **Adoption rate**: Daily active users approving drafts.  
- **Edit frequency**: % of AI drafts sent with vs. without edits.  

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigations  
- **Risk:** AI drafts are low quality or irrelevant.  
  - *Mitigation:* Provide easy editing tools and feedback loops.  
- **Risk:** Bottleneck if too many drafts pile up.  
  - *Mitigation:* Prioritization rules and batch review features.  
- **Risk:** Security breaches in handling sensitive data.  
  - *Mitigation:* Encryption, local processing, secure storage.

## 8. Next Steps  
1. Build **MVP**: IMAP retrieval → ChatGPT draft → User approval → SMTP send.  
2. Add **dashboard** for approvals, editing, and logging.  
3. Implement **rules engine** for prioritization.  
4. Pilot with test users for feedback.
